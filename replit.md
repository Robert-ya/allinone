## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **CSS Organization**: Modular stylesheet approach with separate files for public (`style.css`) and admin (`admin.css`) interfaces
- **Design System**: Consistent use of CSS custom properties and modern design tokens
- **Typography**: System font stack using `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto` for cross-platform consistency
- **Layout Strategy**: Container-based max-width layouts (1200px) with responsive padding

### Styling Patterns
- **Reset Approach**: Universal box-sizing reset with margin/padding normalization
- **Component-Based CSS**: Modular class naming convention (`.admin-container`, `.login-form`, `.site-header`)
- **Responsive Design**: Flexible layouts using flexbox and modern CSS techniques
- **Color System**: Consistent color palette using hex values for grays (#f8fafc, #e5e7eb, #1f2937)

### Authentication UI
- **Admin Login**: Dedicated login form with centered layout and card-style design
- **Session Management**: Logout button implementation in admin header
- **Access Control**: Separate admin styling suggests role-based interface differentiation

- **Brand Identity**: Logo/brand section with icon and text combination
- **Layout Flexibility**: Justified space-between navigation layout for optimal content distribution

## External Dependencies

### CSS Framework Dependencies
