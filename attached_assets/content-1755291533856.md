# SSL Checker

Use our fast **SSL Checker** to help you quickly diagnose problems with your SSL certificate installation. You can verify the SSL certificate on your web server to make sure it is correctly installed, valid, trusted and doesn't give any errors to any of your users. To use the SSL Checker, simply enter your server's public hostname (internal hostnames aren't supported) in the box below and click the Check SSL button. If you need an SSL certificate, check out the [SSL Wizard](https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-certificate-wizard.html).

[More Information About the SSL Checker](https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html#)

The SSL Checker makes it easy to verify your SSL certificates by connecting to your server and displaying the results of the SSL connection. It runs the following checks:

- Whether an SSL certificate is installed
- Whether the server is giving out the correct intermediate certificates so there are no untrusted warnings in users' browsers
- The certificate's expiration date - The SSL Checker even lets you set up a reminder of a certificate's expiration so you don't forget to renew your certificate on time and avoid embarrassing error messages.
- Whether the correct hostname is included in the certificate
- Other problems such as old hash functions

SSL Checker entries may be cached up to a day after repeated checking to conserve server resources. You can check SSL installations on internal names by downloading OpenSSL and running this [OpenSSL command](https://www.sslshopper.com/article-most-common-openssl-commands.html):

**openssl s\_client -connect www.paypal.com:443**

For a more detailed report of the SSL security of your server (including revocation, cipher, and protocol information), check your site using [SSL Labs' SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/). If you have any problems using the SSL Checker to verify your SSL certificate installation, please [contact us](https://www.sslshopper.com/contact-ssl-shopper.html).
